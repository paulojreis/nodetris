# Nodetris

Basic CLI Tetris implementation, still turn-based, built for a coding challenge in node.js. The built basic Tetris modules (game engine and tetrominoes) should be isomorphic JS, i.e., a browser/DOM-based interface should be easy to implement using browserify.

## TODO

* Remove turn-based restriction;
* Make it run in a browser.
